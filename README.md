# Assignment 1 â€” Divide & Conquer Algorithms

## Architecture
The project implements four divide-and-conquer algorithms:

- **MergeSort**: classic divide into halves, linear merge, buffer reuse, and small-n cutoff (switch to insertion sort).
- **QuickSort**: randomized pivot; always recurse on the smaller partition to keep recursion depth O(log n).
- **Deterministic Select (Median-of-Medians)**: group elements by 5, choose median of medians as pivot, recurse only into the required side.
- **Closest Pair of Points (2D)**: sort points by X, recursive split, check in a vertical strip sorted by Y (7â€“8 neighbors).

A `Metrics` class is used to track:
- execution time,
- number of comparisons, swaps, allocations,
- maximum recursion depth.

## Recurrence Relations and Analysis

**MergeSort**
- Recurrence:  
  `T(n) = 2T(n/2) + Î˜(n)`  
- Master theorem, Case 2 â†’ `T(n) = Î˜(n log n)`.

**QuickSort**
- Average case:  
  `T(n) = T(Î±n) + T((1-Î±)n) + Î˜(n)` with randomized pivot.  
  Akraâ€“Bazzi intuition â†’ `T(n) = Î˜(n log n)`.  
- Worst case: `Î˜(n^2)`, but rare.

**Deterministic Select (Median-of-Medians)**
- Recurrence:  
  `T(n) = T(n/5) + T(7n/10) + Î˜(n)`  
- Akraâ€“Bazzi â†’ `T(n) = Î˜(n)`  
- Guaranteed linear time.

**Closest Pair of Points (2D)**
- Recurrence:  
  `T(n) = 2T(n/2) + Î˜(n)` (sorting + strip check).  
- Master theorem, Case 2 â†’ `T(n) = Î˜(n log n)`.

## Experimental Results

### Running time (time vs n)
- MergeSort and QuickSort grow as `n log n`.
- Deterministic Select is close to linear.
- Closest Pair is also `n log n`, but with larger constants.

### Recursion depth (depth vs n)
- MergeSort depth grows logarithmically.
- QuickSort also stays `O(log n)` with some variation due to random pivots.

## Discussion
- Constant factors differ due to cache effects, JVM optimizations, and garbage collection.
- QuickSort often outperforms MergeSort in practice despite both being `Î˜(n log n)`.
- Deterministic Select is slower than randomized selection in practice, but guarantees linear time.
- Closest Pair is more expensive in practice due to sorting and strip management, though still `Î˜(n log n)`.

## Conclusion
Theoretical bounds (Master theorem, Akraâ€“Bazzi) match experimental results:
- Sorting algorithms run in `Î˜(n log n)`.
- Deterministic Select is linear.
- Closest Pair is `Î˜(n log n)` with larger constants.  

**Main differences come from constant factors and JVM runtime behavior.**
